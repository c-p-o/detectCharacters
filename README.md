# detectCharacters
macOS app that uses the Vision framework to automatically create JSON for text animations.

detectCharacters takes PNG and JPEG files containing text as input and uses the Vision framework to return an HTML file containing JSON with coordinates for each letter and line of text, making it easier to create “typewriter” or line-by-line text animations using Greensock.

Notarized apps are available in the [releases](https://github.com/c-p-o/detectCharacters/releases) section.

An example of the HTML output can be viewed [here](https://c-p-o.github.io/detectCharacters/).
