# # detectCharacters
macOS app that uses the Vision framework to automatically create JSON for text animations.

detectCharacters takes PNG and JPEG files containing text as input, and using the Vision framework used to find text for ML/OCR, returns an HTML file containing JSON with the coordinates for each letter and line of text, making it easier to create “typewriter” or line-by-line text animations using Greensock.
